## What is demo_gen?

demo_gen is a backend for creating demonstration webpages automatically from Diplomat FFI definitions. These webpages are meant to showcase the capabilities of your library.


You can view the tracking issue for the demo_gen backend [here](https://github.com/rust-diplomat/diplomat/issues/604).

If you're interested in the design behind demo_gen, we have a [design document](https://github.com/rust-diplomat/diplomat/blob/main/docs/demo_gen.md) viewable on the Diplomat repository.

## Why do I want to use demo_gen?

The current big-name use case for demo_gen is the ICU4X internationalization library. ICU4X has a wide breadth of functions that can be somewhat hard to grasp if you're not already using the library heavily. demo_gen is a quick way 

You can view the ICU4X demo_gen results [here](https://ambiguous.name/icu4x/) for a full demonstration of what demo_gen is currently capable.
