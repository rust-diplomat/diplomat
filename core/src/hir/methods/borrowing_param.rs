//! Tools for traversing all borrows in method parameters and return types, shallowly
//!
//! This is useful for backends which wish to figure out the borrowing relationships between parameters
//! and return values,
//! and then delegate how lifetimes get mapped to fields to the codegen for those types respectively.
//!
//!
//! # Typical usage
//!
//! In managed languages, to ensure the GC doesn't prematurely clean up the borrowed-from object,
//! we use the technique of stashing a borrowed-from object as a field of a borrowed-to object.
//! This is called a "lifetime edge" (since it's an edge in the GC graph). An "edge array" is typically
//! a stash of all the edges on an object, or all the edges corresponding to a particular lifetime.
//!
//! This stashing is primarily driven by method codegen, which is where actual borrow relationships can be set up.
//!
//! Typically, codegen for a method should instantiate a [`BorrowedParamVisitor`] and uses it to [`BorrowedParamVisitor::visit_param()`] each input parameter to determine if it needs to be linked into an edge.
//! Whilst doing so, it may return useful [`ParamBorrowInfo`] which provides additional information on handling structs and slices. More on structs later.
//! At the end of the visiting, [`BorrowedLifetimeInfo::borrow_map()`] can be called to get a list of relevant input edges: each lifetime that participates in borrowing,
//! and a list of parameter names that it borrows from.
//!
//! This visitor will automatically handle transitive lifetime relationships as well.
//!
//! These edges should be put together into "edge arrays" which then get passed down to output types, handling transitive lifetimes as necessary.
//!
//! ## Method codegen for slices
//!
//! Slices are strange: in managed languages a host slice will not be a Rust slice, unlike other borrowed host values (a borrowed host opaque is just a borrowed Rust
//! opaque). We need to convert these across the boundary by allocating a temporary arena or something.
//!
//! If the slice doesn't participate in borrowing, this is easy: just allocate a temporary arena. However, if not, we need to allocate an arena with a finalizer (or something similar)
//! and add that arena to the edge instead. [`LifetimeEdgeKind`] has special handling for this.
//!
//! Whether or not the slice participates in borrowing is found out from the [`ParamBorrowInfo`] returned by [`BorrowedParamVisitor::visit_param()`].
//!
//! # Method codegen for struct params
//!
//! Structs can contain many lifetimes and have relationships between them. Generally, a Diplomat struct is a "bag of stuff"; it is converted to a host value that is structlike, with fields
//! individually converted.
//!
//! Diplomat enforces that struct lifetime bounds never imply additional bounds on methods during HIR validation, so the relationships between struct
//! lifetimes are not relevant for code here (and as such you should hopefully never need to call [`LifetimeEnv::all_longer_lifetimes()`])
//! for a struct env).
//!
//! The borrowing technique in this module allows a lot of things to be delegated to structs. As will be explained below, structs will have:
//!
//! - A `fields_for_lifetime_foo()` set of methods that returns all non-slice fields corresponding to a lifetime
//! - "append array" outparams for stashing edges when converting from host-to-Rust
//! - Some way of passing down edge arrays to individual borrowed fields when constructing Rust-to-host
//!
//! In methods, when constructing the edge arrays, `fields_for_lifetime_foo()` for every borrowed param can be appended to each
//! one whenever [`LifetimeEdgeKind::StructLifetime`] asks you to do so. The code needs to handle lifetime
//! transitivity, since the struct will not be doing so. Fortunately the edges produced by [`BorrowedParamVisitor`] already do so.
//!
//! Then, when converting structs host-to-Rust, every edge array relevant to a struct lifetime should be passed in for an append array. Append arrays
//! are nested arrays: they are an array of edge arrays. The struct will append further things to the edge array.
//!
//! Finally, when converting Rust-to-host, if producing a struct, make sure to pass in all the edge arrays.
//!
//! # Struct codegen
//!
//! At a high level, struct codegen needs to deal with lifetimes in three places:
//!
//! - A `fields_for_lifetime_foo()` set of methods that returns all non-slice fields corresponding to a lifetime
//! - "append array" outparams for stashing edges when converting from host-to-Rust
//! - Some way of passing down edge arrays to individual borrowed fields when constructing Rust-to-host
//!
//! The backend may choose to handle just slices via append arrays, or handle all borrowing there, in which case `fields_for_lifetime_foo()` isn't necessary.
//!
//! `fields_for_lifetime_foo()` should return an iterator/list/etc corresponding to each field that *directly* borrows from lifetime foo.
//! This may include calling `fields_for_lifetime_bar()` on fields that are themselves structs. As mentioned previously, lifetime relationships
//! are handled by methods and don't need to be dealt with here. There are no helpers for doing this but it's just a matter of
//! filtering for fields using the lifetime, except for handling nested structs ([`StructBorrowInfo::compute_for_struct_field()`])
//!
//! Append arrays are similarly straightforward: for each lifetime on the struct, the host-to-Rust constructor should accept a list of edge arrays. For slice fields,
//! if the appropriate list is nonempty, the slice's arena edge should be appended to all of the edge arrays in it. These arrays should also be passed down to struct fields
//! appropriately: [`StructBorrowInfo::compute_for_struct_field()`] is super helpful for getting a list edges something should get passed down to.
//!
//! Finally, when converting Rust-to-host, the relevant lifetime edges should be proxied down to the final host type constructors who can stash them wherever needed.
//! This is one again a matter of filtering fields by the lifetimes they use, and for nested structs you can use [`StructBorrowInfo::compute_for_struct_field()`].
