Lowering error in BadStructFields: found Option<T> in input, where T isn't a reference but Option<T> in inputs requires that T is a reference to an opaque. T = u8
Lowering error in BadStructFields: Results can only appear as the top-level return type of methods
Lowering error in EmptyStruct: struct `EmptyStruct` is a ZST because it has no fields
Lowering error in InStructWithOutField: found Box<T> in input where T is an opaque, but owned opaques aren't allowed in inputs. try &T instead? T = OtherOpaque
Lowering error in InStructWithOutField: found struct in input that is marked with #[diplomat::out]: OutStruct in OutStruct
Lowering error in Opaque::use_foo_ref: found &T in input where T is a custom type, but not opaque. T = Foo
Lowering error in Opaque::return_foo_box: found Box<T> in output where T is a custom type but not opaque. non-opaques can't be behind pointers. T = Foo
Lowering error in Opaque::use_self: Method `Opaque_use_self` takes an opaque by value as the self parameter, but opaques as inputs must be behind refs
Lowering error in Opaque::return_self: Method `Opaque_return_self` takes an opaque by value as the self parameter, but opaques as inputs must be behind refs
Lowering error in Opaque::use_opaque_owned: Opaque passed by value: OtherOpaque
Lowering error in Opaque::return_opaque_owned: Opaque passed by value in input: OtherOpaque
Lowering error in Opaque::use_out_as_in: found struct in input that is marked with #[diplomat::out]: OutStruct in OutStruct
