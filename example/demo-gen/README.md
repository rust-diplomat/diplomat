Proof of concept for tool/src/demo_gen.

The current assumptions are that you would run this on top of a project that already uses js2, so for this example, we just copy from example/js2/api and treat them both as the same package.

TODO:

That's the hope anyways, I need to figure out JS imports enough to see how we can get this working without much config on the developer's side.

Also need to actually implement the copying /api/ duckscript.
