Proof of concept for tool/src/demo_gen.

The current assumptions are that you would run this on top of a project that already uses js, so for this example, we just copy from example/lib/js/api and treat them both as the same package.

For the app, things are written as close to pure HTML and JS as we can get to ensure maximum compatibility.
