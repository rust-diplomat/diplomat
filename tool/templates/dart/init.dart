/// A [Rune] is a Unicode code point, such as `a`, or `ðŸ’¡`.
/// 
/// The recommended way to obtain a [Rune] is to create it from a 
/// [String], which is conceptually a list of [Runes]. For example,
/// `'a'.runes.first` is equal to the [Rune] `a`.
/// 
/// Dart does not have a character/rune literal, so integer literals
/// need to be used. For example the Unicode code point U+1F4A1, `ðŸ’¡`,
/// can be represented by `0x1F4A1`. Note that only values in the ranges
/// `0x0..0xD7FF` and `0xE000..0x10FFFF` (both inclusive) are Unicode
/// code points, and hence valid [Rune]s.
///
/// A [String] can be constructed from a [Rune] using [String.fromCharCode]. 
typedef Rune = int;
/// A list of [Rune]s.
