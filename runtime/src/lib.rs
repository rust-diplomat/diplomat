#![no_std]

//! The [Diplomat](https://rust-diplomat.github.io/diplomat/) runtime crate.
//!
//! This crate provides Diplomat-specific types for crates writing `#[diplomat::bridge]` modules.
//! Include this in any crate that also depends on `diplomat`, since `#[diplomat::bridge]`
//! will generate code that relies on types from here.
//!
//! # Type Overview
//!
//! - **Option and Result**: [`DiplomatResult<T, E>`] (FFI-safe `Result`) and [`DiplomatOption<T>`] (type alias for [`DiplomatResult<T, ()>`]).
//! - **Slices**: [`DiplomatSlice<'a, T>`] (`&'a [T]`), [`DiplomatSliceMut<'a, T>`] (`&'a mut [T]`), and [`DiplomatOwnedSlice<T>`] (`Box<[T]>`).
//! - **String input**: These all map to appropriate string types across FFI.
//!    - Unvalidated UTF-8: [`DiplomatStrSlice<'a>`] (`&'a [u8]`), [`DiplomatOwnedStrSlice`] (`Box<[u8]>`)
//!    - Unvalidated UTF-16: [`DiplomatStr16Slice<'a>`] (`&'a [u16]`), [`DiplomatOwnedStr16Slice`]  (`Box<[u16]>`)
//!    - Validated UTF-8: [`DiplomatUtf8StrSlice<'a>`] (`&'a str`), [`DiplomatOwnedUTF8StrSlice`] (`Box<str>`)
//!    - Unvalidated stringy DSTs: [`DiplomatStr`] (`[u8]`), [`DiplomatStr16`] (`[u16]`), for convenient use with `&` and `Box` as function parameters.
//! - **String output**: [`DiplomatWrite`]
//! - **Callbacks**: [`DiplomatCallback<ReturnType>`] (FFI-safe callback handle).
//! - **Scalars**: [`DiplomatChar`] (`u32`) and [`DiplomatByte`] (`u8`).
//!
//! Note that many of these are type aliases; using these types instead of the type alias signals that Diplomat is expected to
//! generate the equivalent type on the other side. For example, using `DiplomatChar` will signal that a language's `char` type is
//! to be used, even if the actual type seen by rust is an unvalidated `u32`.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! The `log` feature enables logging support, currently enabled via the wasm-only `diplomat_init()`.
//!
//! The `jvm-callback-support` feature should be enabled if building Diplomat for use in the JVM, for
//! a Diplomat-based library that uses callbacks.
