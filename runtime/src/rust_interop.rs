//! Types for interfacing with Diplomat FFI APIs from Rust.
//!
//! By and large, Diplomat helps you produce a Rust-written library that can be called from other
//! languages. You write the library in Rust, but interact with the Diplomat-wrapped library
//! in a non-Rust language.
//!
//! However, either for debugging purposes, or for extending the library in custom ways, you may find
//! yourself wanting to work with the Diplomat-wrapped library from Rust. This module contains
//! utilities for doing that.
