/// An object that can one can write UTF-8 strings to
///
/// This allows the C API to write to arbitrary kinds of objects, for example a
/// C++ std::string or a char buffer.
///
/// The way to use this object is to fill out the `buf`, `len`, `cap` fields with
/// appropriate values for the buffer, its current length, and its current capacity,
/// and `flush` and `grow` with appropriate callbacks (using `context` to reference any
/// state they need). This object will be passed by mutable reference to the Rust side,
/// and Rust will write to it, calling `grow()` as necessary. Once done, it will call `flush()`
/// to update any state on `context` (e.g. adding a null terminator, updating the length).
/// The object on the foreign side will be directly usable after this, the foreign side
/// need not perform additional state updates after passing an [`DiplomatWrite`] to
/// a function.
///
/// May be extended in the future to support further invariants
///
/// DiplomatWrite will not perform any cleanup on `context` or `buf`, these are logically
/// "borrows" from the FFI side.
///
/// # DiplomatWrite is Polymorphic
///
/// Instances of [`DiplomatWrite`] can be created from multiple different sources.
/// There are two constructors available in `diplomat_runtime`:
///
/// 1. [`diplomat_simple_write()`] to write to a fixed-size buffer.
/// 2. [`diplomat_buffer_write_create()`] to write to a Vec allocated by Rust.
///    A wrapper is provided: [`RustWriteVec`](crate::rust_interop::RustWriteVec).
///
/// Backends may have additional constructors for writing to various shapes of buffer.
///
/// ⚠️ Because [`DiplomatWrite`] is polymorphic, the destructor must know how the instance
/// was constructed. It is therefore unsound to use functions such as [`core::mem::swap`]
/// on instances of [`DiplomatWrite`] with potentially different sources. For example,
/// the following code is not safe:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use diplomat_runtime::DiplomatWrite;
/// fn bad(write: &mut DiplomatWrite) {
///   let mut some_other_write: DiplomatWrite = unimplemented!();
///   // Not safe! The two `DiplomatWrite`s have different invariants
///   core::mem::swap(write, &mut some_other_write);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// As a result, any function that returns an owned `DiplomatWrite` or a `&mut DiplomatWrite`
/// must be `unsafe`. For an example, see [`RustWriteVec::borrow_mut`](crate::rust_interop::RustWriteVec::borrow_mut).
///
/// Diplomat backends guarantee they will only ever hand the same type of `DiplomatWrite` object to Rust
/// code; this is only something you need to worry about if using [`RustWriteVec`](crate::rust_interop::RustWriteVec),
/// or `DiplomatWrite` objects manually created in Rust via APIs like `diplomat_simple_write`.
///
/// # Safety invariants:
///  - `flush()` and `grow()` will be passed `self` including `context` and it should always be safe to do so.
///    `context` may be  null, however `flush()` and `grow()` must then be ready to receive it as such.
///  - `buf` must be a valid pointer to `cap` bytes of memory
///  - `buf` must point to `len` consecutive properly initialized bytes
///  - `cap` must be less than or equal to isize::MAX
///  - `grow()` must either return false or update `buf` and `cap` for a valid buffer
///    of at least the requested buffer size.
///  - If grow_failed is true all safety invariants on buf/cap/len MUST still hold.
///  - `DiplomatWrite::flush()` will be automatically called by Diplomat. `flush()` might also be called
///    (erroneously) on the Rust side (it's a public method), so it must be idempotent.
